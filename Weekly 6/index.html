                The author discussed the implications of surveillance and visibility. Many ideas resonate with the
                discourse surrounding privacy and identity under the age of artificial intelligence. Data are extracted
                and analyzed in a more automatic process to form models of behavior and identity. These models are
                shaped by biases, and continue to reinforce the current norms as well as marginalize outside the
                expected patterns. Standing at the intersection of art and technology, I see artists experiment to
                challenge the dominance and surveillance.

                Tech companies own our data and provide content within the usersâ€™ preference based on recommendation
                algorithms. Today these recommendations are surprisingly accurate. Personally I do not like these kinds
                of recommendation. I remembered few years before I often try to search topics that I have no interest or
                knowledge about in order to balance the recommendation algorithms. I want to see diverse content from
                the digital space. I do not know whether creating a more accurate model with data narrows down human
                view. It seems that we are already in the models and cannot think without them.

                Recently I have also seen an interesting project of adding a filter to images to prevent it from studies
                by image generation models. Similar to the artworks mentioned in the article, these engineers are
                working on a new mask in the virtual space trying to maintain the integrity of images and visuals.
