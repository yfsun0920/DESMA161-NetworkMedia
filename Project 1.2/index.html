                    <h1> Tao Te Ching </h1>
                    <p>The Tao that can be told of</p>
                    <p>Is not the Absolute Tao;</p>
                    <p>The Names that can be given</p>
                    <p>Are not Absolute Names.</p>

                    <p> The Nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth;</p>
                    <p>The Named is the Mother of All Things.</p>

                    <p>Therefore:</p>
                    <p> Oftentimes, one strips oneself of passion</p>
                    <p> In order to see the Secret of Life;</p>
                    <p> Oftentimes, one regards life with passion,</p>
                    <p>In order to see its manifest forms.</p>

                    <p>These two (the Secret and its manifestations)</p>
                    <p>Are (in their nature) the same;</p>
                    <p>They are given different names</p>
                    <p>When they become manifest.</p>

                    <p> They may both be called the Cosmic Mystery:</p>
                    <p> Reaching from the Mystery into the Deeper Mystery</p>
                    <p> Is the Gate to the Secret of All Life.</p>
