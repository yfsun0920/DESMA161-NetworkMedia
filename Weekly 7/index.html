                DEEPFAKES AND CHEAP FAKES
            </a> </h1>
        <h2> by The Data & Society report </h2>

        <div>
            <p>
                The advent of synthetic media like deepfakes and cheap fakes has complicated the digital information.
                The ability to create convincingly realistic manipulated videos creates significant challenge to
                information verification and media trust. Anyone with access to the technology with a set of training
                data can create a deepfake.
            </p>

            <p>
                However, in the broader context of misinformation, the introduction of deepfakes might be seen as a
                continuation of long-standing practices rather than a completely new phenomenon. Propaganda,
                disinformation, and manipulation have been common throughout history; what deepfakes do is provide
                another, more advanced tool to carry out these practices.

            </p>

            <p>
                The realistic deepfakes creates technical difficulties of detection. The development of deepfake
                technology has probably outpaced the ability to detect and regulate it, creating a gap to be exploited.
                Deepfakes has change the peopleâ€™s trust in the digital space. Traditionally, people relied on certain
                institutions and authorities to provide reliable information, but with the decentralization of
                information sources and reliance on user generated content, deepfakes has undermine the credibility of
                online information. Though I did not have much experience of being fooled by information I saw on social
                media, I felt that I tended to trust people I have connection with.

            </p>

            <p>

                Reading the report four years after it is written, I found it was predicting the problems we are facing
                today. AIGC is changing every industry from tech, design, to finance, entertainment, and much more. It
                is a powerful tool that helps to break the border of imagination and efficiency. However, misuse of the
                tool and difficulty of detection will put people who do not have much knowledge about it in danger.
                Responding to the challenges will require technological, social, and legislative efforts.
